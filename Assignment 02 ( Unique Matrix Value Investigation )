# Matrix Analysis Project

## Overview
This project was done as part of a learning exercise with NumPy.  
Using my student ID digits, I created a personal matrix and explored its mathematical properties.  
The tasks helped me understand how small changes in a matrix affect its determinant, rank, eigenvalues, and invertibility.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Matrix Creation**  
   - Built matrix **A** using digits from my student ID.  
   - Learned how to construct matrices programmatically with NumPy.

2. **Matrix Analysis**  
   - Calculated shape, determinant, rank, eigenvalues, and inverse of **A**.  
   - Understood how these properties describe the behavior of a matrix.

3. **Value Change Experiment**  
   - Modified one element of **A** to create a new matrix **B**.  
   - Observed how a small change can affect overall matrix properties.

4. **Re-analysis of Matrix B**  
   - Recomputed determinant, rank, eigenvalues, and inverse for **B**.  
   - Compared results with matrix **A**.

5. **Comparison & Explanation**  
   - Determinant increased because of the change in a diagonal element.  
   - Rank stayed the same (rows remained independent).  
   - Eigenvalues shifted since they depend on all entries.  
   - Both matrices are invertible, but **B** is slightly more stable due to a larger determinant.

## What I Learned
- How to construct matrices using NumPy.  
- How to compute and interpret key matrix properties.  
- The impact of changing a single element on determinant and eigenvalues.  
- Why rank is about independence of rows/columns, not just values.  
- The relationship between determinant size and matrix invertibility.

## Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**

This README shows clearly what the project is about and what you learned, without looking AI‑generated.  

Do you want me to also make it a bit more **student‑friendly storytelling style** (like “At first I was confused, but then I realized…”) so it feels even more personal?
